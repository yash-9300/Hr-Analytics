# Hr- Analytics

The objective of this project was to assist and provide valuable insights to HR professionals by creating a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard helping to understand why employees leave , identify trends enabling them to make informed decisions and developing strategies to reduce employee attrition rates.









## About Dataset

The Dataset is provided by @MeriSKILL during my Internship period as a Data Analyst Intern 

This Dataset is provided in a CSV format. The Dataset makes up with 35 relavent features which includes age,Attrition,Gender,JobRole etc






# Dashboard Created:

The Dashboard is created in Power BI Desktop which consist of several reports such as Demographics , Turnover Analysis I , Turnover Analysis II , Employee Wellness which will help the company determine what action they will need to take to retain more employees.
The analysis of the employee data involves creation of calculated measures and columns using Power Query and DAX in Power BI. It also involves plotting correlation map (Heatmap) using Python visual for all numeric variables of the dataset to identify the strength and direction of the relationship between variables. In this dashboard, grouping plays a crucial role in organizing and presenting the data effectively. The design of the dashboard is tailored to utilize the power of grouping for enhanced data visualization and analysis.

Evaluate and redesign job roles , especially the job role of Laboratory Technician, to better align with employee skills and interests.
